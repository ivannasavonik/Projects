# Projects
Here you can see the projects on which I had the opportunity to work on my own and with my classmates during my graduate studies.

In the folder 'Breast Cancer' you find the Matlab project on the Breast Cancer Detection (Variables Machine Learning binary models (LDA, QDA, SVM, Logistic Regerssion, Naive Bayes Classifier, Classification trees, Random Forests) and feature selection and reduction methods were applied on Matlab. We also optimized the hyperparameters in order to obtain the best results.

The LDA.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook containing a little project on topic modelling with the NLP. It consists of applying an unsupervised machine learning technique called Latent Dirichlet Allocation in order to find different topics in the wine reviews. The project includes multiple text preprocessing steps including tokenization, bigrams and trigrams, ponctuation removal etc.

The "Opioid use abuse" folder contanins a Python project on the binary classification. In this project we applied supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, as well as tried to apply Lasso, Ridge and Elastic net regularization in order to select the most relevant features. As supervised Machine Learning techniques we used LDA, SVM, Random Forests, Logistic Regression and we also applied some Deep Learning Techniques including Artificial Neural Networks. As the unsupervised technique we used the KNN clustering. The dataset used for this project is huge and contains some missing values, whith what we dealt in this project. The target variable is unbalanced, thus we use some undersampling techniques to balance the dataset and specific metrics in order to correctly evaluate the performance of our algorithms.

You can also find the document on the business plan called 'backery_project.pdf'. It is a business plan on a 'green, ecological and local' backery. It is not a Machine Learning project.
